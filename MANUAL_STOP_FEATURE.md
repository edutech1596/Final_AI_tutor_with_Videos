# Manual Stop Recording Feature

## Overview
Added a manual stop recording button to give users more control over voice input, complementing the existing automatic silence detection (2 seconds) and max duration (20 seconds) features.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure
- Added a new "Stop Recording" button (`stopRecordingBtn`) in the input actions area
- Button is hidden by default and only appears when recording is active
- Located between the voice button and send button for easy access

### 2. CSS Styling
- **Button Design**: Red gradient background with pulsing animation
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Animation**: Subtle pulse effect to draw attention while recording
- **Responsive**: Flexbox layout for proper alignment

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

#### Recording Flow:
1. **Start Recording** (Click microphone üé§):
   - Voice button hides
   - Stop button appears with red pulsing animation
   - Status message: "üé§ Recording... Click Stop when done or wait for auto-stop!"

2. **Stop Recording** (3 ways):
   - **Manual**: User clicks "‚èπÔ∏è Stop" button
   - **Silence Detection**: 2 seconds of silence detected
   - **Max Duration**: 20 seconds recording limit reached

3. **After Stopping**:
   - Stop button hides
   - Voice button reappears
   - Audio is processed and sent to STT

#### Benefits:
- **User Control**: Users can stop exactly when they finish speaking
- **Prevents Malfunctions**: Addresses cases where silence detection fails
- **Better UX**: Clear visual indicator of recording state
- **Flexible**: Works alongside existing automatic stop methods

## UI States

### Normal State
```
[üìé Image] [üé§ Voice] [‚û§ Send]
```

### Recording State
```
[üìé Image] [‚èπÔ∏è Stop] (pulsing) [‚û§ Send]
```

## Technical Details

### Button Visibility Logic:
- `voiceBtn.style.display`: 'flex' (normal) / 'none' (recording)
- `stopRecordingBtn.style.display`: 'none' (normal) / 'flex' (recording)

### Stop Recording Reasons:
- `stopRecording('manual')`: User clicked stop button
- `stopRecording()`: Automatic (silence or max duration)

### Status Messages:
- Manual stop: "‚è≥ Processing your recording..."
- Auto stop: "‚è≥ Processing..."

## Testing

### Test Cases:
1. ‚úÖ Start recording ‚Üí Click stop button ‚Üí Verify audio is processed
2. ‚úÖ Start recording ‚Üí Wait 2 seconds silence ‚Üí Auto-stop works
3. ‚úÖ Start recording ‚Üí Wait 20 seconds ‚Üí Max duration auto-stop works
4. ‚úÖ Button visibility toggles correctly
5. ‚úÖ Multiple recording sessions work properly
